# A Blog Website
 
I designed and built a blog website using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB featuring user registration and authentication with blog post creation , modification and deletion . The platform includes responsive design, search functionality, and an admin dashboard for content moderation, showcasing my skills in full-stack development.
